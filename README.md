## Project Description:

This project addresses the challenge of predicting insurance charges by utilizing machine learning regression techniques. The primary aim is to accurately estimate charges for the company's customers. By achieving high accuracy in predictions, the project reduces both cost and time spent by the company in this process. Additionally, the automation of this process allows customers to quickly and easily access information regarding their charges with minimal input required.

- The dataset employed in this project is obtained from Kaggle, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).
- It consists of the following variables:
  - Age: Age of the primary beneficiary.
  - Gender: Gender of the insurance contractor (male or female).
  - BMI: Body Mass Index of the beneficiary (ideal range is between 18.5 to 29.5).
  - Children/Dependents: Number of dependents or children covered by the insurance.
  - Smoker: Indicates whether the beneficiary is a smoker or not.
  - Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
  - Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
